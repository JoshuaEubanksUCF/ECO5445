# Chapter 3, Part A: Using Functions

## Functions That Python Provides

Some functions are *built-in*

```python 
>>> abs(-9)
9
>>> abs(3.3)
3.3
``` 

A *function call* is of the form
```function_name(argument_1, argument_2, argument_3, ...)```.
Arguments can be any value stored in memory. 
That is, any variable or value that is defined before the function call. 


```python 
>>> day_temperature = 10
>>> night_temperature = 3
>>> abs(day_temperature - night_temperature)
7
>>> day_temperature = 3
>>> night_temperature = 10
>>> abs(day_temperature - night_temperature)
7

``` 
You can combine the outputs of functions as operands in
arithmetic operators: 
```python 
>>> abs(-7) + abs(3.3)
10.3
``` 


```python 
>>> 3 + 5 / abs(-2)
5.5

``` 
or as arguments in other functions

```python 
>>> pow(abs(-2), round(4.3))
16

``` 

Some functions convert from one type to another

```python 
>>> int(34.6)
34
>>> int(-4.3)
-4
>>> float(21)
21.0

``` 
The ```help``` function will show documentation for a function.

```python 
>>> help(abs)
Help on built-in function abs in module builtins:

abs(x, /)
    Return the absolute value of the argument.

``` 
The ```round``` function also converts a floating-point number 
into an integer:

```python 
>>> round(3.8)
4
>>> round(3.3)
3
>>> round(3.5)
4
>>> round(-3.3)
-3
>>> round(-3.5)
-4

``` 
but it can also be used to convert to a float with fewer significant digits.

```python 
>>> round(3.141592653, 2)
3.14

``` 


```python 
>>> help(round)
Help on built-in function round in module builtins:

round(...)
    round(number[, ndigits]) -> number

    Round a number to a given precision in decimal digits (default 0 digits).
    This returns an int when called with one argument, otherwise the
    same type as the number. ndigits may be negative.

``` 
There is more than one way to calculate exponents. 

```python 
>>> help(pow)
Help on built-in function pow in module builtins:

pow(x, y, z=None, /)
    Equivalent to x**y (with two arguments) or x**y % z (with three arguments)

    Some types, such as ints, are able to use a more efficient algorithm when
    invoked using the three argument form.

``` 
If you pass only two arguments, it takes the empty value ```None``` by default.

```python 
>>> pow(2, 4)
16
``` 
If the third argument is provided, it performs the additional calculation. 

```python 
>>> pow(2, 4, 3)
1
``` 


## Memory Addresses: How Python Keeps Track of Values

The name of each variable corresponds to a location in memory.
The ```id``` function returns an integer that identifies that location in memory.

```python 
>>> help(id)
Help on built-in function id in module builtins:

id(obj, /)
    Return the identity of an object.

    This is guaranteed to be unique among simultaneously existing objects.
    (CPython uses the object's memory address.)

``` 

Some values are already stored in memory.

```python 
>>> id(-9)
4301189552
>>> id(23.1)
4298223160
```

Other variables that you create are immediately assiggned to locations in memory.
```python
>>> shoe_size = 8.5
>>> id(shoe_size)
4298223112
>>> fahrenheit = 77.7
>>> id(fahrenheit)
4298223064

``` 
Even functions are classified as objects in memory and 
are assigned to locations in memory. 
```python 
>>> id(abs)
4297868712
>>> id(round)
4297871160

``` 

### Python Remembers and Reuses Some Objects

Python stores some very common numbers in special places in memory
and reuses these locations as needed. 
```python 
>>> i = 3
>>> j = 3
>>> k = 4 - 1
>>> id(i)
4296861792
>>> id(j)
4296861792
>>> id(k)
4296861792

``` 
This is not the case for larger integers or floats. 
```python 
>>> i = 30000000000
>>> j = 30000000000
>>> id(i)
4301190928
>>> id(j)
4302234864
>>> f = 0.0
>>> g = 0.0
>>> id(f)
4298223040
>>> id(g)
4298223016

``` 



## Defining Our Own Functions

You might want to have a function that can convert temperature from
Fahrenheit to Celsius.
It should work as follows.

```python 
>>> convert_to_celsius(212)
100.0
>>> convert_to_celsius(78.8)
26.0
>>> convert_to_celsius(10.4)
-12.0

``` 
But if you run those function calls before the function is defined, 
Python throws an error:

```python 
>>> convert_to_celsius(212)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'convert_to_celsius' is not defined

``` 
So, you have to define the function. 
Function definitions take the following format:

```python 
>>> def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
...     return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
...

``` 
The indenting is important because that is how Python
knows when the function definition is complete. 

```python 
>>> def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
... return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
  File "<stdin>", line 2
    return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
         ^
IndentationError: expected an indented block

``` 
After the function is defined, you can use it
just as you would for built-in functions. 

```python 
>>> def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
...     return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9
... 
>>> convert_to_celsius(80)
26.666666666666668

``` 
When you use a function to calculate its output from the arguments, 
it is called *calling* the function.
Test it with a few values.

```python 
def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit):
	return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9

convert_to_celsius(80)
convert_to_celsius(78.8)
convert_to_celsius(10.4)

``` 

Look for some documentation, just as you would for built-in finctions.

```python 
>>> help(convert_to_celsius)
Help on function convert_to_celsius in module __main__:

convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit)

``` 

There is no documentation. 
*You* made the function, *you* provide the documentation. 
You do that by including a docstring, a description
enclosed in triple quotes, which includes a written 
description and some examples. 

```python 
def convert_to_celsius(fahrenheit: float) -> float:
    """Return the number of Celsius degrees equivalent to fahrenheit
    degrees.

    >>> convert_to_celsius(75)
    23.88888888888889
    """

    return (fahrenheit - 32.0) * 5.0 / 9.0


convert_to_celsius(80)
convert_to_celsius(78.8)
convert_to_celsius(10.4)

``` 

Now try the ```help``` function again. 



### Keywords Are Words That Are Special to Python

Because the ```def``` keyword was used to define a function, 
it cannot be used as a variable. 

```python 
>>> def = 3
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    def = 3
        ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax
```
The same applies to built-in function names that are already defined. 

```python
>>> def return(x):
  File "<stdin>", line 1
    def return(x):
             ^
SyntaxError: invalid syntax

``` 

But be careful: this does not apply to functions that *you* define. 
When you overwrite your own function, the original definition 
is discarded and replaced with the new function. 




## Using Local Variables for Temporary Storage

It often helps make code more clear when you use separate 
local variables for intermediate calculations. 
These are called *local* variables because they are only 
defined in the memory allocated within the function. 

```python 
>>> def quadratic(a, b, c, x):
...     first = a * x ** 2
...     second = b * x
...     third = c
...     return first + second + third
...
>>> quadratic(2, 3, 4, 0.5)
6.0
>>> quadratic(2, 3, 4, 1.5)
13.0

``` 

After you run the function, these variables 
no longer exist outside of the function. 

```python 
>>> quadratic(2, 3, 4, 1.3)
11.280000000000001
>>> first
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'first' is not defined
```

Even the arguments are only defined within the function. 
Try calling a value that was defined within the quadratic function. 
```python
>>> a
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
NameError: name 'a' is not defined

``` 

These arguments, without a default value, must be provided, 
even if you assigned them a value in a previous function call. 
```python 
>>> quadratic(1, 2, 3)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: quadratic() takes exactly 4 arguments (3 given)

``` 
The more errors you see, the easier it will be for you to 
identify what the problem is and how to fix it. 

## Tracing Function Calls in the Memory Model

What do you think this function does?

```python 
>>> def f(x):
...     x = 2 * x
...     return x
...
>>> x = 1
>>> x = f(x + 1) + f(x + 2)
``` 

Python keeps track of all the intermediate calculations
in separate places in memory, one for each of the different ```x```'s above.

See the explanation in *Practical Programming* on pages 40-46.
